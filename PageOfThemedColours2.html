 	<h1>Page of Themed Colours: Red and Brown</h1>
  	<p>
      Main text is usually best in either a dark shade or light shade depending on the contrast. 
	  The colour of text is important, like this text, it cannot be dark red since it becomes almost 
      illegible in contrast to the dark brown background:
      <br><br> <span style="color:rgb(140,0,0)";> This is tough to read and </span>
      <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)";> this is not as effective as </span> 
      <span style="color:rgb(255,255,255)";> this.</span> </br> </br>
      These colours remind me of chocolate with raspberries, or a volcanic scene.
