 	<h1>Page of Themed Colours: Red and Brown</h1>
  	<p>
      Red and brown, these colours remind me of chocolate with raspberries, or a volcanic scene.
      Main paragraph text is usually best in either a dark shade, or light shade depending on the contrast.
	  The colour of text is important; like this text; which cannot be dark red since it becomes almost
      illegible because of the dark brown background. If the text were white, it would have a strong
      contrast to the dark brown background; making it highly visible. If the text were black; there would
      be less contrast making it harder to read:
      <br><br> <span style="color:rgb(140,0,0)";> This is tough to read and </span>
      <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0)";> this is not as effective as </span>
      <span style="color:rgb(255,255,255)";>this.</span></br></br>
    </p>
    <div>
      As opposed to a lighter background where the contrast is different.
      It's now this text,
      <span style="color:rgb(255,255,255)";>compared to this text.</span></br>
      <span style="color:rgb(140,0,0)";>This text; the same colour text as before; is now legible.</span></br>
    </div>
