   	<h1>Page of Themed Colours: Red and Brown</h1>
  	<p>
      Red and brown, chocolate with raspberries or a volcanic scene with ash and rock.
      Main paragraph text is usually best in either a dark shade, or light shade depending on the contrast.
	    The colour of text is important; like this text; which cannot be a medium dark red since it becomes almost
      illegible because of the dark brown background. If the text were a light shade of red like it is now; it would
      have a strong contrast to the dark brown background; making it highly visible. If the text were a dark shade of
      red; there would be less contrast making it harder to read:
      <br><br>
      <span style="color:rgb(140,0,0)";> This medium-dark red is tough to read and </span>
      <span style="color:rgb(50,0,0)";> this darker shade of red is not as effective as </span>
      <span style="color:rgb(255,170,170)";>this lighter shade of red.</span>
      </br></br>
    </p>
    <div class="lighterbrown">
      <span class="colorexample" style="color:rgb(50,0,0)";>As opposed to a lighter background where the contrast is different.
      It's now this text,</span>
      <span class="colorexample" style="color:rgb(255,170,170)";>compared to this text.</span></br>
      <span class="colorexample" style="color:rgb(140,0,0)";>This text; the same colour text as before; is now legible.</span></br>
