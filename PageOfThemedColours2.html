  	  <h1>Page of Themed Colours: Red and Brown</h1>
  	    <p>	
  	      Main text is usually best in either a dark shade or light shade depending on the contrast. 
  	      The colour of text is important, like this text, it cannot be dark red since it becomes almost 
  	      illegible in contrast to the dark brown background. These colours remind me of chocolate with
  	      strawberries or raspberries.
