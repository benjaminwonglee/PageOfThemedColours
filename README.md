# PageOfThemedColours

This is a series of HTML and CSS pages to help learn new skills coding HTML and CSS, or practice coding in those languages.
The idea is to create pages that are colour coordinated, and be able to link them together with links; 
being able to go backwards and forwards in series. 

This is a series of HTML pages designed with specific colours... literally called PageOfThemedColours.

Currently there is one related project to this going on. It is a PseudoRandomBackgroundDrawer to output a 
bitmap to put on the backgrounds for these HTML pages. 

The first thing to do is to click "Fork" and fork your own copy of this to your GitHub account... However I have no idea how it works so 
please let me know how that goes, I'm keen to find out, and comment on the issue that I posted regarding this.

If there are any burning questions, please contact me, Benjamin Wong-Lee via e-mail: benjaminwonglee@gmail.com, or via social media.  

**AIM**

Ultimately, the aims of this project include improving coding skills to create something that looks nice, using version control
effectively; avoiding merge conflicts by committing code relatively frequently, and working as a team. 

**RULES**

There is no real template to designing a page, the rules are simple; just use two or three colours to make a page that looks nice, with
particular regard to the use colour. Some kind of explanation to why it looks nice should be written on the page. Please note any of the
issues you're fixing on the "Issues" section before going ahead and fixing them so we have a log of the issues that are being addressed and 
fixed throughout the project. Learning won't happen by copying and pasting from the code I've already written, I recommend researching what 
specific tags are and what they do if you're unsure, learning is more influential that way. Like I said, no layout rules, no template, 
design a nice looking page, that's all.

Please respect version control and practice using branches whenever possible. Resolving merge conflicts is a manual thing where you have 
to go through whole files and decide what should go where; it's a hassle; so try to keep changes to a small set of files and commit
relatively frequently; this is called continuous integration; a well-known version control practice. 

Good luck!
