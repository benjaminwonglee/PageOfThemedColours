  	<h1>Page of Themed Colours</h1>
  	<p>	
  		This series of pages will attempt to showcase
  		colours that generally go well together.<br>
  		For example:
  	</p>
  	  <ul>
  	    <li>Gold and purple</li>
  	    <li>Dark red and brown</li>
  	    <li>Pink and white</li>
  	    <li>Orange and green</li>
  	  </ul>
  	<p>	
  		While some colours go well together,
  		they can be hard on the eyes,
  		or can be visually incompatible with the
  		environment they're placed in.
