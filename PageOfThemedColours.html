  	    This series of pages will attempt to showcase some colours that generally go well 
  	    together. 
  	    <br>For example:</br>
  	  </p>
  	</div>
  	  <ul>
  	    <li>Gold and purple</li>
  	    <li>Dark red and brown</li>
  	    <li>Pink and white</li>
  	    <li>Orange and green</li>
  	  </ul>
  	<div style= "padding-left:20px;">
  	  <p>	
        While some colours go well together, they can be also be hard on the eyes, or can be 
  	    visually incompatible with the environment they're placed in. There are also colours
  	    that don't go well together.
