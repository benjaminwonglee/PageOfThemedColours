  	  <h1>Page of Themed Colours: Gold and Purple</h1>
  	    <p>
  	      This series of pages will attempt to showcase some colours that generally go well
  	      together.
  	      <br>For example:</br>
  	    </p>
  	</div>
  	  <ul>
  	    <li>Gold and purple</li>
  	    <li>Red and brown</li>
  	    <li>Pink and white</li>
  	    <li>Orange and green</li>
  	  </ul>
  	<div class="mainbox">
  	  <p>
        While some colours go well together, they can be also be hard on the eyes, or can be
  	    visually incompatible with the environment they're placed in. There are also colours
  	    that don't go well together.
  	  </p>
