  	<h1>Page of Themed Colours</h1>
  	<p>	
  		This page will attempt to connect colours that 
  		generally go well together. For example:
  	</p>
  	  <ul>
  	    <li>Yellow and deep purple</li>
  	    <li>Dark red and brown</li>
  	    <li>Pink and white</li>
  	    <li>Orange and green</li>
  	  </ul>
  	<p>	
  		While some colours go well together, this isn't always a good thing.
  		Some are hard for the eyes to handle, or are visually incompatible 
  		with the environment they are placed in.
